What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	The semantic tags make the code easier to read, and can make it a lot easier to find a specific part of the code. For example, using <nav> would make it very easy to change navigation links since they would be so easy to find. They also help organize the content for people using screen readers, making it easier to view.


What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	They are in order from first to last. So elements on top are loaded first.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
	Learned how to create a snippet. Took a little while but it is very easy to do, and yes I'd imagine I would use this in the future. Any piece of code that I find myself writing over and over could be turned into a snippet which would both save me time and ensure that everything is typed correctly.


What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	I was unfamiliar with the charset information that went into the head tag. I think I understand it now, it tells the browser which character set to load, but it might be worth looking into more to see what other sets are available and what the purpose might be to select a different set. Other than that I think I understood all the concepts.
