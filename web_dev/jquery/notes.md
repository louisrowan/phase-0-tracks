# Release 0: Make a plan
1. Find/watch a couple JQuery tutorial videos on youtube
2. Find a JQuery tutorial on w3
3. Actively experiment with code while following the tutorials
4. Take 1-2 breaks as needed.
Start time: 4:45

#To know:

$(function() {
});

fadeOut, delay, SlideDown, fadeToggle

.css({color: 'red'})

puts css properties in quotes if there is a hyphen, like 'background-color'

use .html() to change html. example:
$('#div1').html('<p>new text</p>'');

click, mouseover

with .css, put both property and value in quotes (separated by comma) like this:
$("body").css("background-color", "red");

# Release 1:
My strategy worked very well. I started by finding the jquery tutorial on w3 which showed how to properly link up an html page so that it can use jquery
After that I found a very helpful series of youtube videos that showed the basics of using jquery, I coded along with the examples to make sure the info really stuck. I spent 2 hours on this, stopping briefly a couple times just to walk around. I think breaks are helpful but sometimes it is best to just work through a problem, there was 1 point when I was stuck and not getting a concept but instead of stopping I kept at it and eventually figured out what I was missing. Overall I'm very pleased with what I learned in the 2 hours and feel well prepared to put what I learned into practice.
